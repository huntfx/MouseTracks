[MVP]
- [GUI] reworked map types  - cursor[sequential|density|speed] click[L|M|R][single|double|held|] thumb[L|R][seq|den|spd] keyboard[pres|held]
- [Config] Enable / disable each type of tracking
- Legacy import

[Bugs]
- disable.mtk2 is being saved
- Start tracking after stopped, RuntimeError: "no tick data received" in Processing.profile_age_days

[QOL]

[Low Priority]
- Check if the main hub is running, and if not close down the process
- Option to disable multi monitor handling, track both separately
- Export CSV
- Handle multiple windows from the same process if they have the same PID (eg. HP Anyware/Teradici)
- Add optional padding around heatmaps
- [Config] Choose network interfaces to show
- User friendly API (eg. from mousetracks2.api import profile, render; render(profile('main'), type='mouse clicks'))
- When attempting to save while unable to, make sure messages are sent back so that the process doesn't close
- Gamepad rendering
- Option to run as elevated

[Future Ideas]
- Per button click heatmaps
- Store last X hours in history, scroll back in time.
- Combine renders with different colours (eg. lmb as red, mmb as blue, rmb as green, or game1 as BlackToRed, game2 as BlackToBlue)
