[MVP]

[Bugs]
- [Tracking] Errors raised in `pynput` are not handled
- [Tracking] If click occurs before tracking starts, self.data is not set - `self.data.pynput_opcodes.discard(MOUSE_CODES[idx])`

[QOL]
- [GUI] When switching profiles, pixels are queued for drawing with the incorrect offset data

[Low Priority]
- Option to disable multi monitor handling, track both separately
- Export CSV
- [Config] Choose network interfaces to show
- When attempting to save while unable to, make sure messages are sent back so that the process doesn't close
- Gamepad rendering
- Option to run as elevated

[Future Ideas]
- Store last X hours in history, scroll back in time. Perhaps this could be a separate component that will make memory management easier.
