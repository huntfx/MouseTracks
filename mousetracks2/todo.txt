[MVP]
- Remove reliance on legacy `mousetracks.image.colours`
- [Config] Enable / disable each type of tracking

[Bugs]
- disable.mtk2 is being saved
- When starting tracking after stopped, got `RuntimeError: "no tick data received"` in `Processing.profile_age_days`
- [Tracking] Errors raised in `pynput` are not handled

[QOL]
- [GUI] Stop updates when stop state signal is sent
- [GUI] When switching profiles, pixels are queued for drawing with the incorrect offset data
- [GUI] Shift + right click on tray for debug options

[Low Priority]
- [GUI] Choose which mouse buttons from render
- [GUI] Window always on top option for debugging
- Check if the main hub is running, and if not close down the process
- Option to disable multi monitor handling, track both separately
- Export CSV
- Handle multiple windows from the same process if they have the same PID (eg. HP Anyware/Teradici)
- Add optional padding around heatmaps
- [Config] Choose network interfaces to show
- User friendly API (eg. from mousetracks2.api import profile, render; render(profile('main'), type='mouse clicks'))
- When attempting to save while unable to, make sure messages are sent back so that the process doesn't close
- Gamepad rendering
- Option to run as elevated

[Future Ideas]
- Per button click heatmaps
- Store last X hours in history, scroll back in time.
- Combine renders with different colours (eg. lmb as red, mmb as blue, rmb as green, or game1 as BlackToRed, game2 as BlackToBlue)
