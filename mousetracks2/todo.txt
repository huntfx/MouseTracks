[MVP]

[Bugs]
- [Tracking] Errors raised in `pynput` are not handled

[QOL]
- [GUI] When switching profiles, pixels are queued for drawing with the incorrect offset data

[Low Priority]
- Try option to use time heatmap to act as an alpha channel on time, clipping of 75% seems to work well
- Update AppList.txt online, add --offline flag to block
- Option to disable multi monitor handling, track both separately
- Gamepad rendering
- Option to run as elevated

[Future Ideas]
- Store last X hours in history, scroll back in time. Perhaps this could be a separate component that will make memory management easier.
